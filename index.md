what sinister secrets are hidden around here? look for the `flag`! remember: stay [stylish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)) and safe every [15 march](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March).

the [web inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) is your friend, and remember that your flag may be [obfuscated](https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/10/top-10-codes-keys-and-ciphers). :)
