congrats on making it to level two! [here's a file](/files/vigenere.png). you might have to hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> to save it.

we thought it was a corrupted image, but now we're thinking otherwise. maybe it's actually [holding some other files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format))? who knows, the `.png` might have been a sham all along.

other potentially useful info we've gathered:

- the filename before the `.png` might be important too, somehow
- we heard something about the owner's `key` being on a `bicycle`? hmm, maybe in a `bicycle`… maybe it *was* a `bicycle`…
